# Leap 'O Fate

# 11/15

- Updated absolute coordinate in graphics.asm, sprites.asm, and sprites.inc
- Worked on absolute coordinate with potential collision in player.asm

# 11/16

- Realized that I don't have to update absolute coordinate when the background moves
  but only when the player moves
- Got collision with first spike! @ Index: $6D
- Now to compare with tile index
